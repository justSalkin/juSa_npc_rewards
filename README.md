# juSa_npc_rewards (v.1.2.1)
A script that allows you to create NPCs and assign various functions to them. <br>
You can create NPCs with one of the following functions:

"give" = NPC gives player items <br>
"sell" = NPC takes items and pays amount of $ back <br>
"exchange" = NPC takes item or money and gives money or another item back <br>
"nointeraction" = just an NPC, you can't interact with them <br>

If you found a bug, if you have an idea for the <br>
next version, or if you simply need some help,<br>
pls let me know here on github.
