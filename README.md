A script that allows you to create NPCs and assign various functions to them. <br>
You can create NPCs with one of the following functions:

"give" = NPC gives player items <br>
"sell" = NPC takes items and pays amount of $ back <br>
"exchange" = NPC takes item or money and gives money or another item back <br>
"nointeraction" = just an NPC, you can't interact with them <br>
